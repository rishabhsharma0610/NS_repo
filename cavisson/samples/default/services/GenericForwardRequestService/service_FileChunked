<h3> Why NetStorm ? </h3>

               <p>Today.s Web applications involve a multitude of component
1fd
s which impact the performance of a web application as perceived by end users.  Some components which play a key role are user behavior patterns, number of active users, user arrival rate, speed of user's connection to the internet backbone, geographic location of user relative to the application data center and internet traffic patterns. The dependency on network is continuously increasing as web applications deliver more content to the user.s browser.</p>

      <p>Moreover, users are geographically di
1fd
stributed world-wide, with internet connection speeds varying widely. The appropriate combination of these parameters is required to simulate the true behavior of a web application in production.
</p>
      <p>It is ever more critical and complicated to test a web application in a manner which realistically simulates a large and diverse user population interacting with a web application over the internet. The operating system and applications of the NetStorm appliance are specifically designed for this p
1fd
urpose.</p>
      <h3>Unique Capabilities:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><span class="bullet-title">Massive, Internet scale load generation</span> . NetStorm makes tests with millions of active users not only possible, but easy to manage. Ability to run high volume tests in a controlled lab environment allows multiple executions while .tweaking. appropriate variables being analyzed, with the assurance that other variables will not change. Without such a solution, the only alternative is to use a microcosm of
1fd
 users, which is likely to produce distorted results. NetStorm appliances can create simultaneous TCP connections to simulate millions of users.
      </li>

            <li><span class="bullet-title">Internet-True<sup>TM</sup> load modeling</span> . Number of concurrent users "spike" dramatically, when responsiveness of the web application or network degrades, as each user contributes more processing time on the website.  This results in an avalanche of sessions and transaction loads. To enable modeling
1fd
 such scenarios,  NetStorm design of test scenarios are based on user arrival rate and number of concurrent users.</li>

      <li><span class="bullet-title">Internet-True<sup>TM</sup>  WAN simulation</span> . NetStorm's Linux based operating system is designed from the ground up to provide true simulation of WAN behavior, as experienced by actual web application users.  With a networking stack built for this purpose, NetStorm can simulate packet delay, packet loss, packet re-ordering and packet duplicat
1fd
ion. Packet delays can be configured as fixed or pure random delays. The product also allows to specify other distributions for randomizing packet delays - Normal (bell curve), Uniform Random or Pareto distribution. These behaviors can be configured for each user segment, according to their location relative to the data centers.
      <li><span class="bullet-title">User Modem simulation</span> - Netstorm provides true Modem behavior by simulating connection multiplexing which happens in real user modems 
1fd
and modem compression.</li>

      <li><span class="bullet-title">Goal based scenario design</span> . With NetStorm, test scenarios can  be designed using causal criteria (e.g. number of concurrent users) or  symptomatically (e.g. load the system until 95 percentile of response times are less than 300 ms).</li>
      <li><span class="bullet-title">Built-in internet topographies</span> enable real world  modeling of test scenarios based on actual geographical distribution of users.  For instance, a test s
1fd
cenario can be modeled to run with 20% users in  EMEA , 35% eastern US, 20% western US, 15% Asia and the data center in Boston, MA. NetStorm introduces appropriate WAN degradation characteristics(see WAN simulation) based on built-in empirical mapping, which can be easily customized.</li>
      <li><span class="bullet-title">Web user behavior simulation</span> . Built-in  mechanisms allow modeling of page reloads and clickaways by users.  </li>
      <li><span class="bullet-title">Powerful monitoring</sp
1fd
an> to allow deep insight into  the behavior of the application as the tests are executing.</li>

      <li><span class="bullet-title">Advanced tools</span> for recording application flows,  management of test suites, comparing test runs and reporting.
        <ul>
          <li>Real Browser simulation (not just User-Agent  string).</li>
          <li>Support for parameterization, co-relation and  content verification.</li>
